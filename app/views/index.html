      <p class="govuk-body">A verification report is a new kind of pre-sentence
        advice. It can be used for lower complexity cases that are suitable for
        electronic monitoring curfew, unpaid work sentences, fines or a
        combination of these. This allows probation practitioners to be
        proactive in identifying suitable cases and will reduce the need for
        unnecessary adjournments.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">There are a number of steps to be taken between
        considering suitability to completing the verification report itself.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">1. Check the case meets the criteria for a
        verification report</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">You must confirm a defendant's suitability for
        either a verification report, a pre-sentence report or no advice. This
        is done though reviewing and gathering information.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">2. Arrange and hold the screening interview</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The screening interview is an opportunity to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>discuss and validate information already collated such as
          accommodation, employment and health</li>
        <li>gather further evidence to inform and confirm the contents of the
          verification report</li>
        <li>consider any complexities or rehabilitative needs linked to race,
          age or sex through completion of the diversity and inclusion form
          (DIF)</li>
        <li>use professional curiosity and judgement when considering how the
          person has presented</li></ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">The defendant should be informed in advance via
        letter or telephone, of the screening interview to provide any paperwork
        or evidence to verify their current circumstances. A telephone call
        gives an opportunity for information about the defendant's
        residency to be gathered which will enable checks for an electronic
        monitoring curfew to be made.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If concerns arise during the screening interview
        that would suggest a full assessment is required due to rehabilitative
        or risk needs, the verification report should be completed with the
        information you have gathered, noting the concerns that require further
        assessment. Any new risks identified as a result of the screening
        interview need to be reviewed against existing risk registrations in
        NDelius, making any updates as required.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">3. Complete and share the verification report</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can complete the verification report in any
        order, over a period of time, adding information as you get it.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you are still waiting on checks coming back you
        should save a draft and include the missing information when you get
        it.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">In order to edit the verification report, you will
        need to have Microsoft Word installed on your device and select 'Open in
        Word desktop app'.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You should:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>download the verification report template from NDelius</li>
        <li>save it to NDelius as you make changes and once complete</li>
        <li>share it on Common Platform and inform the court that it's available
          to view</li>
        <li>save it on Prepare a case for sentence (PACFS) so that you can
          easily refer to it in court</li>
